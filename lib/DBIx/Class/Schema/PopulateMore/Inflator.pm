=head1 NAME

DBIx::Class::Schema::PopulateMore::Inflator - Base Class for keyword Inflators

=head1 DESCRIPTION

When L<DBIx::Class::Schema::PopulateMore::Command> executes, it uses a visitor object 
(see L<DBIx::Class::Schema::PopulateMore::Visitor> to descend the key values of the
data hash that is used to put stuff into the given tables.  If it finds a value
that matches a particular regexp, that means the value needs to be inflated and
it's passed to the inflating dispatcher, which finds the correct Inflator based
on the given namespace.
