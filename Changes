Revision history for Perl extension DBIx-Class-Schema-PopulateMore.

0.19 Thursday, October 9, 2014
    - increase some dependency minimum version to solve some reported
      test fails.

0.18 Wednesday, June 4, 2014
    - Port to Moo
    - documentation typo fixes
    - fixed a bug ...::Command where some code was not immutable

0.17 Monday, May 9, 2011
    - Changed column definition from integer to varchar since that column takes
      characters as well as numbers and the newest DBIC enforces this.

0.16 Thursday, February 24, 2011
    - update copyright info
    - migration to new Module::Install maint tools
    - Updated dependencies to modern and supportable versions
    - modernized some schema code practices

0.15 Tuesday, August 24, 2010
    - Use more modern Moose stuff and updated to modern dependencies.
    - formatting changes (no tabs, etc.)
    - fixed some author only test failures

0.14 Monday, August 17, 2009
    - Increased the flexibility of allowed incoming arguments and documented
      this change.  Added test for this format.

0.13 Monday, July 6, 2009
    - Fix an error with the way we parse command inflators so that if a source
      string contains '::' it won't give us the wrong lookup index
    - Changed from using 'confess' to using the DBIC throw exception method
    - More minor documentation updates.

0.12 Tuesday, June 30, 2009
    - More tweaks to try and fix my broken local Module::Install

0.11 Monday, June 29, 2009
    - Minor doc changes and dependency tweaks to fix more cpan fails

0.10 Sunday, June 28,  2009
    - changed the find inflator to allow multikey finds
    - more Makefile.PL tweaks to solve some cpan reported errors

0.09 Friday, June 26, 2009
    - Added a Find inflator, with docs and a test case

0.08 Friday, June 26, 2009
    - Fixed some documentation issues
    - fixed the copyright
    - arguments now allowed to be both array and arrayref.  This should reduce
      some line noise in some config file types or if you are just using a perl
      structure.

0.07 Friday, June 26, 2009
    - Add a placeholder to make sure the t/var directory is around at test
      time.

0.06 Thursday, June 25, 2009
    - Added SQLT to the build recommends, otherwise tests fail

0.05 Thursday, June 25, 2009
    - Updated all the required versions to more recent items, since that
      is what I can test on, plus most of that older stuff has known
      compatibility issues.
    - Requires Perl 5.8.8 since I can't test this on 5.8.6 anywhere (patches
      or test cases welcomed.)
    - changed the way we set default timestamp on sqlite.  this fixes a lot of
      failed test cases.  Now all tests pass for me and I cleared most of the
      types of test failues I see in the backlog.
    - Updated Docs a bit.
0.04 Friday, June 04, 2008
    - Moved namespace of component from DBIx-Class-PopulateMore

    - Fix for messed up POD and missing Makefile.PL

    - Initial release
